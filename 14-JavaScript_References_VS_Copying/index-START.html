      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players
      console.log(players, team)

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = 'Lux'

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // slice
      const team2 = players.slice()

      // Array.from
      const team3 = Array.from(players)

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team4 = [].concat(players)

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team5 = [...players]

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team5[3] = 'howdy'
      console.log(team5)
      console.log(players)

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person
      // captain.number = 99

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })
      console.log(cap2)

      // Object spread (another option)
      const cap3 = { ...person }

      const ree = {
        name: 'Ree',
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: '@ree',
          facebook: 'ree.lin',
        },
      }
      console.clear()
      console.log(ree)

      // this clones deeply
      const me = { ...ree }

      // this does not clone deeply 
      // if there is an object property, we copy only the reference
      // so mutating that nested object will mutate the original
      const alt = Object.assign({}, ree)
